# Health Risks Analysis Charts

By analyzing the current trends shaping people's lives, I created an interactive chart to help readers understand the findings.

The information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System was used to generate this feature story for D3 Times.

## Resources
The data set included is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml. This data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."
